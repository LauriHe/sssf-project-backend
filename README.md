# SSSF Project - Lauri Heikkinen

## What does the project do? ‚ùì
The basic concept of the application is that users can create, share and modify notes and todo lists. You can think of it as a simplified version of Trello / Microsoft Planner etc.

## Why the project is useful? ü§î
The project is useful for taking quick notes or doing some basic project planning.

## What is the target audiance? üë™
The possible use cases and users for the application are quite broad so it‚Äôs a bit difficult to narrow down the focus group. However because the app is quite basic in it‚Äôs functionality it will probably cater more towards casual users who just want to take some quick notes or make a shopping list etc. The app is not designed for big group projects or users that need a lot of features.
